# Portfolio Project
## This is my personal web pag for Digital Product Management, portfolio project.
To run the code for this project, it must first be downloaded to GitHub dekstop. Then it should be all ready to go and run. If you want to use this project for your own website, you will need to replace the photos used to your own pictures, as well as replacing the favicons used and changing the link for it to your own personal link.

### Have Fun! ðŸ˜€
